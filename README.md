# MAKE: Multi-Aspect Knowledge-Enhanced Vision-Language Pretraining for Zero-shot Dermatological Assessment

## Abstract

Dermatological diagnosis represents a complex multimodal challenge that requires integrating visual features with specialized clinical knowledge. We introduce MAKE, a Multi-Aspect Knowledge-Enhanced vision-language pretraining framework for zero-shot dermatological tasks. Our approach addresses the limitations of existing vision-language models by decomposing clinical narratives into knowledge-enhanced sub-texts, connecting subcaptions with relevant image features, and adaptively prioritizing different knowledge aspects. Through pretraining on 403,563 dermatological image-text pairs, MAKE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art VLP models on eight datasets across zero-shot skin disease classification, concept annotation, and cross-modal retrieval tasks.
